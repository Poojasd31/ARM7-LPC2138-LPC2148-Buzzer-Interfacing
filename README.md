# ARM7-LPC2138-LPC2148-Buzzer-Interfacing

Overview

A buzzer is an output device used to generate sound.

Two types of buzzers:

Active buzzer → Generates sound with DC voltage (just ON/OFF).

Passive buzzer → Requires square wave input to produce tone (PWM or timer output).

ARM7 GPIO pins can be used to control active buzzer directly.

Passive buzzer can be driven by PWM using timers.
